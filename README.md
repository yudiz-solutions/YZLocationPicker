## API Description
If you want to add your custom UI then following APIâ€™s will help you to find address.

### Search with google
+ Search your address with search text and it retuns custom Address array for related addresses in block which contains name and place `referenceID` of place. after that you can fill your UI according, you can also cancel previous request by using sessionDataTask. Also this method return one enum in block for `netWorkError`, `loading`, `noResult` and `success`.

```
func searchTextDidChange(textField: UITextField){
    if sessionDataTask != nil{
        sessionDataTask.cancel()
    }

    let str = textField.text?.trimmingCharacters(in: NSCharacterSet.whitespacesAndNewlines)
    sessionDataTask = YZAPICalls.shared.getReferenceFromSearchText(text: str!, block: { (addresses, resType) in
       // Your code
    })
}
```

+ After search term you need fulladdress, latitute and longitute of place. for this you need to call `getLocationFromReference` with place `refId` and it returns address structure with address, lat and long.

```
YZAPICalls.shared.getLocationFromReference(ref: arrData[indexPath.row - 1].refCode, block: { (address, error) in
    if error == nil{
        // Your Code
    }
})
```
